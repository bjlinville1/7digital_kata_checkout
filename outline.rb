# Josh & Steve - I'm just going to comment throughout this to give you guys as clear a picture of my thought process as I can. I begin by outlining my solution, then pseudo coding it. 

#Checkout Program
  #Accept user input, and return the sum of the costs of the items they wish to purchase
  #There should be an ability to offer special pricing on "bulk" orders of the items

# First we need to create our items.
# Next we need to count the quantity of each item entered by the user.
# Next we need to check to see if any quanities have qualified for special pricing.
#   If they qualify, we need to apply the special prices, as well as account for any of the same item which do not.
# Finally we need to sum the prices of all the items, with their special prices applied, and return it.
